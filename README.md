## Important Notes

- **Accessing `.next/` folder**:  
  The `.next` folder is **auto-generated** when you build or run the app.  
  If you don't see it, just run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Accessing `node_modules/` folder**:  
  The `node_modules` folder is created automatically when you run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  You **do not need to manually upload** these folders.  
  They are **recreated** based on your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
